dumbest kid in kindergarten(still dumb tho)

### Languages:
- Lambda Calculus for aesthetics and transcendence. Just in case you don't know, Alonzo Church's discovery(cuz it's too good to be artificial) is much much more elegant than his padawan's tape-eating amalgamation of zeros and ones. If there's a language that describes the universe, I don't think it's math. It's probably some adaptation of typeless Lambda Calculus. 
- Lua wow amazing little language I'm in love with the moon. Fluent in Lua and have some experience developing with it, including Pico8 and Love2d. No I don't play Roblox.
- C++ for competetive programming, only knows the procedural part
- C for actually a ton of stuff. Lua's C API and arduino C to just name two. Very willing to read the Linux Kernel in the future.
- Java for school. APCSA is the dumbest thing I've every come across that calls itself "programming". Java is just a bad language. Do yourself a favor and use Kotlin.
- Haskell for interests and type theory. Quoting from [John Tromp](http://tromp.github.io/cl/cl.html), "the wonderfully elegant Haskell language, which is basically pure typed lambda calculus with lots of syntactic sugar on top".
- Lisp/Scheme for the Book. Ah yes, the Book. Go read it if you haven't already.
- Brackets for... well, wasting my time. (Will probably build on this for a new langauge.)
- Brainfuck. I just happened to come across this thing 4 years ago. Don't wanna talk about that.

### Game Dev:
- Engines/Frameworks:
- Love2D. Absolutely amazing framework. One of my favourite Tetirs Emulators, Techmino, was built on Love2D. Truly runs on all platforms.
- Unity. C# ah yes not really a fan of OOP so yeah.
- Pico8. Sometimes post technical dicussion threads. Have several plans on this platform.

### Facts:
- Suck at art, open to collaboration cuz I can't draw shapes on screen.
- Pan.
- the ultimate procrastinator. Seriously.
- Interested in NLP, but don't know where to start.
- Browses Pixiv daily.
